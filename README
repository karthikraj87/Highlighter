Scope: 
Given a document and query which are strings, search for the most relevant snippet of length 400 characters with the query terms highlighted (string)
Searches for the exact match for the query in the doc and returns the snippet if an exact match is found
Else removes some common words from the query and tries to match as many individual words in the resultant query in the doc.

Extensions:
	- Assign priorities for words in the search query and append output text according to the rules of priority so that sentences matching higher priority 
	  words have a higher probability of being part of the snippet returned
	- Suggest matches for possibly misspelled query strings 
	
Usage:
	highlight_doc("Sample doc", "Search query")
